Hi there!

Welcome to this project where my three teammates and I created a predictor for NYC housing prices. 
Through the dataset from year 2016-2017, we used supervised models in shallow learning for optimized predictions. 
Some models included Ridge Regression, K-Nearest Neighbor, Random Forest, and XGBoost. 
We ended up seeing the best performance among the more complex tree-based models. 

An end-to-end pipeline is built within the notebook for the most automated performance. 
To see more, please read the notebook.
