<h1> NYC Housing Price Prediction</h1>

Welcome to this project where my three teammates and I created a predictor for NYC housing prices. 
Through the dataset from year 2016-2017, we used supervised models in shallow learning for optimized predictions. 
Some models included `Ridge Regression`, `K-Nearest Neighbor`, `Random Forest`, and `XGBoost`. 
We ended up seeing the best performance among the more complex tree-based models. 

An end-to-end pipeline is built within the notebook for the most automated performance.
